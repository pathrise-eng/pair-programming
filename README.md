# Internal Pair Programming Resources

Below is as documented of a process for doing Pair Programming sessions as I could muster to make. :) 

## Emails Before Pair Programming Session

* Templated emails are sent out the day that pair programming sessions happen (Tue/Thur @ 1pm, Sun @ 10am)
* The templated email links to the our contentful doc on [what pair programming is](https://fellows.pathrise.com/knowledge/guides/what-is-pair-programming) and when the sessions are (this will have to be updated if/when the sessions times change
* The emails also state clearly that fellows should arrive within 5 minutes or will be locked out of the room
* The templates are in the Streaks Gmail shared Pathrise account

## What To Do Before A Pair Programming Session
* Find a question to ask for the session. I do this by...
  * Going to leetcode and filtering questions by tags (looking for POPULAR questions that have high frequency)
  * The reason for looking at the tags is to make sure I don't always end up picking a question with the same answer type (I found that I was doing a lot of DFS questions because that's an answer for a lot of leetcode mediums)
  * Go to the pair programming question folder, copy a doc that has a previous question, and edit the copy to contain a new question
  * Go to the [pair programming hackerpair worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5CFJVw-wMcHUDaSYzeD6npqdC-2mUJhBlR4atHR7Ks/edit#gid=0) and wipe the names off the excel sheet and reset the hackerpair links if needed (details on how to do so are below in another section)
  

## What To Do During A Pair Programming Session
* I start off showing [this link about pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/) and explain that...
  * Pair programming was a paradignm invented in the 90's to increase programmer efficiency and decrease bugs
  * Driver = person typing at keyboard, Navigator = person thinking about the problem in a broader context and watching for mistakes
* I give the link to the [pair programming hackerpair worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5CFJVw-wMcHUDaSYzeD6npqdC-2mUJhBlR4atHR7Ks/edit#gid=0) after the 5 min mark has passed and I'm not going to let anyone else in the google hangouts (to avoid having to repair everyone)
* I explain that people have to type their name in the excel sheet **and press enter**. This sounds dumb but if I don't say it some people will type their name and then I can't see it and don't pair them properly
* After a minute or so I pair everyone up like so...
